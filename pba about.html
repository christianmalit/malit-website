	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<h2 align="center"> <font color="blue">is a men's professional basketball league in the Philippines composed of twelve company-branded franchised teams.<br> Founded in 1975, it is the first professional basketball league in Asia and is the second oldest continuously professional basketball league existing in the world after the NBA,<br><br>[1] established before the "open era" of basketball in 1990 where FIBA allowed longstanding domestic leagues, which mostly had predated the PBA, to become professional. The league's regulations are a hybrid of rules from the NBA and FIBA.<br>

<br> <br>The league played its first game at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City on April 9, 1975.<br>[2] Its main offices are located along Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5 road), Eastwood City, Bagumbayan, Quezon City.

	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<h2 align="center"> <font color="blue">MANILA, Philippines -- Robert Bolick had a superb debut to power the NorthPort Batang Pier to a comfortable 117-91 victory over the Blackwater Elite in their first game of the 2019 PBA Philippine Cup on Wednesday at the Araneta Coliseum.

In his first game as a professional, Bolick -- the third overall pick in the 2018 PBA Rookie Draft -- scored 26 points on 10-of-12 shooting, going a perfect 7-of-7 from inside the arc.

Five other players scored in double-digits for the Batang Pier, with Paolo Taha notching 21 points, and Stanley Pringle adding 16 markers on top of 7 rebounds, 6 steals, and 5 assists. Sean Anthony added 19 points.

"It's a total team effort," said NorthPort coach Pido Jarencio after the game. "Lahat, they did their share."

"We're making our shots, 'yung decision-making, maganda," he added. "We're complementing each other, nagpapasahan, we're getting rebounds. We're running. 'Yan ang basketball namin."
